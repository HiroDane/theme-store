# SuperGradient

This **Zen theme** gives you powerful and good looking gradients with many options to customize it to your liking.
It automatically adapts to light or dark mode, adjusts the accent color to the gradient and works flawlessly with compact mode.

## Available Gradients (Need to be enabled in the Theme Settings; Only one at a time to avoid conflicts):
  - "Northern Horizen": A blue-green'ish gradient
  - "Scarlet Dusk": A red-yellow'ish gradient
  - "Amethyst Claret": A blue/purple-red'ish gradient (Depicted in the picture)
  - "Olive Sunset": A green-red'ish gradient
  - "Midnight Majesty": A yellow-purple'ish gradient

## Optional Features (toggle in Zen's theme settings):
  - Brighten the colors of the gradient
  - Desaturate the colors of the gradient
  - Use Zen's accent colors (e.g. on tabs, set in Zen's "Look and Feel" setting) instead of accent colors adjusted for the gradient
  - Switch the colors order in the gradient
